## üö´ **Development Issues Encountered**

### **1. Model Loading and Memory Management**
**Issue**: NVIDIA NeMo models are computationally heavy and require significant GPU/CPU resources
- Initial model loading took 30-45 seconds on first request
- Memory consumption peaked at 2-3GB for larger models
- Container startup time was significantly increased

### **2. Audio Processing Challenges**
**Issue**: Inconsistent audio quality and format compatibility
- Some MP3 files had encoding issues that caused conversion failures
- Audio normalization didn't work uniformly across different input sources
- Sample rate conversion occasionally introduced artifacts

### **3. Docker Environment Complexity**
**Issue**: Balancing container size with functionality
- Base NVIDIA images are large (5-8GB)
- FFmpeg installation increased container size significantly
- Managing Python dependencies with CUDA compatibility was complex

### **4. Real-time Processing Limitations**
**Issue**: Synchronous processing bottlenecks
- Single-threaded model inference created request queuing
- No streaming support for longer audio files
- Limited concurrent request handling

## ‚ùå **Unimplemented Components & Limitations**

### **1. Multi-Language Support**
**What**: Dynamic language model switching
**Limitation**: 
- NeMo models are language-specific and require separate model loading
- Would significantly increase memory usage (2-3GB per language)
- Model switching would introduce latency

### **2. WebSocket Streaming**
**What**: Real-time audio transcription
**Limitation**:
- NeMo models are designed for batch processing, not streaming
- Would require chunking audio and managing state across chunks
- Increased complexity for maintaining context between chunks

### **3. Batch Processing**
**What**: Multiple file processing in single request
**Limitation**:
- Memory constraints with current model loading approach
- Would require queue management system
- Risk of timeout issues with multiple large files

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Limitations & Assumptions**

### **Current Deployment Limitations**

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|---------|------------|
| **Single Model Loading** | Only English ASR supported | Document language requirements clearly |
| **Memory Usage** | 2-3GB RAM minimum required | Specify hardware requirements in docs |
| **File Size Limits** | 30-second audio maximum  |


### **Deployment Assumptions**

1. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - Minimum 4GB RAM available
   - CPU with AVX support (for optimal performance)
   - Optional: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support

2. **Network Environment**:
   - Stable internet connection for initial model download
   - Adequate bandwidth for audio file uploads
   - Low-latency environment preferred

3. **Usage Patterns**:
   - Audio files are pre-recorded (not real-time streaming)
   - Primarily English language content
   - Moderate concurrent usage (< 5 simultaneous users)

4. **File Assumptions**:
   - Audio quality is reasonable (not heavily distorted)
   - Clear speech with minimal background noise
   - Standard sample rates (16kHz, 22kHz, 44.1kHz)

### **Production Considerations**

- **Security**: Currently no authentication - implement API keys for production
- **Rate Limiting**: No current limits - could be overwhelmed by high traffic
- **Data Privacy**: Temporary files are cleaned but consider encryption at rest
- **Monitoring**: Limited logging - implement comprehensive monitoring for production use
- **Backup**: No redundancy - single point of failure in current setup
